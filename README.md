The number of online payment options has expanded thanks to e-commerce and several other websites, raising the possibility of online fraud. Due to an increase in fraud rates, academics have begun employing various machine learning techniques to identify and analyse online transaction fraud. The primary purpose of the study is to create and implement unique fraud detection algorithm for streaming transaction data with goal of analysing historical customer transaction information and extracting behavioural patterns, whereby cardholders are grouped according to value of their transactions. Then, using the sliding window method, combine the transactions performed by cardholders from several groups so that each group's unique behaviour can be retrieved. The groupings are then used to train various classifiers individually in future. The classifier with the highest rating score can then be selected as one of the most effective ways to detect fraud. In this study, we used credit card dataset.
